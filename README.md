# Behavioral design patterns.

Behavioral design patterns aim for identification of common ways of communication patterns among objects.

Behavioral design patterns are:

1. **Chain of Responsibility:** Pass requests along a chain; e.g., purchase approval levels decide on a purchase's acceptance or escalation.

2. **Command:** Encapsulate operations as objects; e.g., undo/redo functionality in a text editor using command objects.

3. **Iterator:** Sequentially access elements of a collection; e.g., for-each loop iterating through elements of a list.

4. **Mediator:** Centralize communication between objects; e.g., air traffic control manages communication between airplanes for safe navigation.

5. **Memento:** Capture and restore an object's state; e.g., undo mechanism in a text editor saves and restores document states.

6. **Observer:** Define a one-to-many dependency; e.g., stock market observers react to changes in stock prices.

7. **State:** Alter an object's behavior as it changes state; e.g., vending machine behavior changes based on operational states.

8. **Strategy:** Define a family of algorithms; e.g., sorting algorithms in a library encapsulated as strategies for flexible sorting.

9. **Template Method:** Define the skeleton of an algorithm; e.g., building construction with a template method for common construction steps.

10. **Visitor:** Define operations on elements without modifying their classes; e.g., spell-checking different document elements without changing their structure.
