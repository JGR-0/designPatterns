# Air Traffic Control System Requirements:

**Objective:** Develop a system to simulate air traffic control, ensuring safe communication and navigation among airplanes.

1. **Airplane Representation:**
   - Each airplane in the system should be represented as an object with essential attributes:
      - Unique identifier (ID)
      - Current position (latitude, longitude)
      - Altitude
      - Speed
      - Destination

2. **Communication Interface:**
   - Create an interface for communication between airplanes. This interface should include methods for:
      - Registering airplanes
      - Sending messages between airplanes
      - Updating airplane positions

3. **Communication Management:**
   - Implement a communication management class responsible for facilitating communication between airplanes. This class should maintain a list of registered airplanes and manage message exchange. It should also handle updates of airplane positions to ensure safe distances.

4. **Air Traffic Control Center:**
   - Develop an Air Traffic Control Center class as the user interface. This class should have methods for:
      - Registering airplanes with the communication management system
      - Broadcasting messages to all airplanes
      - Receiving and displaying updates from airplanes

5. **Collision Detection:**
   - Incorporate a collision detection mechanism within the communication management system to ensure airplanes maintain a safe distance. If two airplanes come too close, issue warnings and corrective actions.

6. **User Interface (Optional):**
   - Create a simple user interface to interact with the Air Traffic Control Center. This interface should allow users to register new airplanes, send messages, and visualize the positions of airplanes.

7. **Testing:**
   - Set up a testing environment to simulate multiple airplanes interacting with the communication management system. Test scenarios should include takeoff, landing, and mid-flight communication.

8. **Logging and Reporting:**
   - Implement logging functionality to record communications, warnings, and any corrective actions taken by the system. This information can be useful for analysis and auditing.

**Notes:**
- Ensure that airplanes communicate through the designated communication management system, avoiding direct communication between airplanes.
- Design the system to handle dynamic changes, such as airplanes entering or leaving the airspace.
- Prioritize safety, and ensure the collision detection mechanism is robust.
- Consider scalability and performance in handling a large number of airplanes.
